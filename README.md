# **üçè ProbApple üçé** 
A **Prob**abilistic model to forecast **Apple** yield and high-quality yield. 

# Background
Fruit growers aim to produce high-quality apples in their orchards. An approximation for the total yield and the high-quality yield at harvest early in the season, helps the apple producers in their operational planning. We developed ProbApple a probabilistic model, based on Monte Carlo simulations to forecast apple yield and high-quality yield a four key time points during the vegetation period: ‚Äòat full bloom‚Äô, ‚Äòbefore fruit thinning‚Äô, ‚Äòafter June drop‚Äô, ‚Äòfour weeks before harvest‚Äô. 

This repository contains all files to run ProbApple and visualize the results. Additionally the results for a case study on 'Gala' apple the German Rhineland are available here. Model and case study are described in the manuscript *ProbApple ‚Äì A probabilistic model to forecast apple yield and quality* by [Christine Schmitz](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz), [Lars Zimmermann](https://github.com/Lars-Zimmermann), [Katja Schiffers](https://github.com/katjaschiffers), Martin Balmer and [Eike Luedeling](https://github.com/eikeluedeling). 
The code is written in R (R Core team, 2024)[^1] and mainly uses the package decisionSupport (Luedeling et al., 2021)[^2]. Further functions from the packages tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019)[^3], png (Urbanek, 2022)[^4], patchwork (Pedersen, 2024)[^5] and ggtext (Wilke, 2022)[^6] were used to sort and visualize the simulation results.

# Respository content

## ProbApple model

[`ProbApple_Code.R`](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz/ProbApple/blob/main/ProbApple_Code.R) contains the functions for the ProbApple model. After loading the required packages, the functions for the yield and quality sub-models are defined. The sub-models were combined to one model function for each forecasting time point. 

[`Simulations_with_ProbApple.R`](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz/ProbApple/blob/main/Simulations_with_ProbApple.R) loads the ProbApple model and the required inputs to run a Monte Carlo simulation. This script is needed to generate simulation results with ProbApple. Here the model is applied for two different management scenarios with and without anti-hail netting.  

## Input files

[`apple_quality_input_Gala.csv`](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz/ProbApple/blob/main/apple_quality_input_Gala.csv) contains all estimates which are related to growing region and apple variety, but not orchard or year specific. 

[`apple_estimation_Gala.csv`](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz/ProbApple/blob/main/apple_estimation_Gala.csv) contains all estimates which are orchard- and year-specific. 

[`Management_inputs.csv`](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz/ProbApple/blob/main/Management_inputs.csv) and [`Management_inputs_without_hailnet.csv`](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz/ProbApple/blob/main/Management_inputs_without_hailnet.csv) lists all management measures which are implemented in ProbApple and a value of 0 or 1 for each measure. 1 means that a measure is installed/conducted and 0 means that the measure is not done. 

## Results 
In a case study, we applied ProbApple for a Gala orchard in the Rhineland, an important apple growing region in western Germany. We tested it for two different management scenarios: with and without anti-hail netting. 
[`MC_results`](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz/ProbApple/blob/main/MC_results) is a folder containing the simulation results for both scenarios at all four forecasting time points (at full bloom, before fruit thinning, after June drop and 4 weeks before the estimated harvest date). The results are provided as RDS and csv files. The RDS files could be used in R to further analyse the results, while cvs file could be used in other programs as well.

## Visualization of the results
[`Plotting_ProbApple_simulation_results.R`](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz/ProbApple/blob/main/Plotting_ProbApple_simulation_results.R) generates histogram plots for yield and high-quality yield, it calculates and plots the Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) and provides a histogram plot to compare high-quality yield the management scenarios. To structure the results of the PLS regression for the VIP plot, the function in [`Sorting_VIP_data.R`](https://github.com/ChristineSchmitz/ProbApple/blob/main/Sorting_VIP_data.R) is needed.
